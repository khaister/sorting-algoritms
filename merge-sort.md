# Merge Sort

> __Time Complexity__: O(_n_ log _n_) (average/worst)
\
> __Space Complexity__: O(_n_)

## Characteristics

* Not in-place

## Steps

1. Divide the unsorted list into _n_ sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).
2. Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
